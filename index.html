                    Hi, I'm Matt, a Full Stack Developer. I've always wanted to be a programmer, and finally took the
                    plunge to formalize my education in the fall of 2019. I studied at the University of Arizona's
                    Extension Coding Boot Camp (Go Wildcats!) and graduated early summer of 2020. With the amazing
                    curriculum at UofA, I was able to master CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScipt for the front end. For the
                    backend I use MYSQL and MongoDB. I also learned JQuery, Bootstrap, Handlebars and React.js.
                </strong></p>

            <p><strong>
                    Since graduating with my UofA certificate, I've been continuing my education by learning Java,
                    Python and Php.
                </strong></p>

            <p><strong>
                    My family is my biggest motivator. Not only did they support me during my education, but they are my
                    biggest fans in all that I do involving programming. Take a look at my portfolio, which has been
                    thoroughly approved by my 2 year old as "cool" and I hope you feel the same.
